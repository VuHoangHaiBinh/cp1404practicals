# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

80%

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

From 60% -> 80% 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Never expect to finish earlier than your expectation (it either means you missed something or broke something)

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

- Not much. Not many people review thoroughly for me

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

- How to be respectful while also giving your own opinion
- Spot the problems in other people code using existing knowledge
- Learn of new tricks or programming methods that others use

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code review 1 link](https://github.com/candicechristyy/CP1404/pull/3#issuecomment-2746906095)

### Explanation

- I always use the phrase "I think" indicating that my judgements aren't always right and if the other student found any misleading info, they should message me to point out the mistake
- I was able to point out the foundation principles and terms so students can easily understand
- I always put a small overall comment at the end, complimenting the person of their hard work but also encourage the to fix their mistakes (showing we are all here to learn)

### Good Code Review 2

[Code review link 2](https://github.com/Bennynee/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issuecomment-2795829752)

### Explanation

- Same as the above review
- This time I formatted by answer more neatly (with problem, reference, suggestion)
- I added the use of reference to show that I have evidence backing my words (and so students can more easily trace the principle they need)
- I make sure the suggestions are always right on point and not lengthy (commenting right on the line) and suggest probable solutions but not directly re-code their program the way I want (making sure students should figure out the code by themselves)

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

- Put a penalty on students who don't do the practicals, hence making other students cannot do peer code review (this simply makes the hard working students lose out on the opportunity to improve just for some arrogant rich kids to play their games)
- Make the practicals harder and make that the main marking criteria (instead of making challenging practicals where students actually need to think thoroughly about how to write code to accomplish what their want, the practicals are really just a game of perfectionism where if you make 0 mistakes you get full mark which just make it super boring). The learning process is suppose to be a fun playground where students are encouraged to make mistakes and learn from them, debating the problem / solution with a peer or teacher to come up with the most brilliant idea. But right now I just see a bunch of robots who need to not forget a random docstring in the program
- Make more practicals like the assignment, students need to learn by doing, not by following a pathway (template) that has already been drawn out by the lecturer. Most of the practicals are simply modifying a pre-existing file provided, but instead we should only give the students clear instructions (example: Write a ray tracing kivy app, simple 2D platformer in pygame, these all take like 20 mins of reading document and 15 mins of youtube tutorial to learn), make the project fun yet challenging, make students research more about API and not restraint them to a method that was taught on class, let them learn math needed for the project, research alternative libraries available for the same task.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

- Read the requirements clearly and make a plan before coding
- Re-tracing completed task to ensure proper completion
- Applied class and OOP inheritance to improve program
